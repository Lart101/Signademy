# Sign Language Video Assets

This directory should contain MP4 video files showing how to sign each letter of the alphabet.

## Expected File Structure:
```
assets/sign_language_mp4/
├── A.mp4    - Video showing how to sign letter A
├── B.mp4    - Video showing how to sign letter B
├── C.mp4    - Video showing how to sign letter C
├── ...      
└── Z.mp4    - Video showing how to sign letter Z
```

## Video Requirements:
- Format: MP4
- Duration: 3-5 seconds (looping recommended)
- Resolution: 720p or higher
- Focus: Clear view of hand signing the letter
- Background: Clean, contrasting background
- Lighting: Good lighting to see hand clearly

## Current Status:
✅ **Video files available** - All letter videos (A-Z) and number videos (0-9) are present!

## Available Videos:
- **Letters**: A.mp4 through Z.mp4 (26 videos)
- **Numbers**: 0.mp4 through 9.mp4 (10 videos)
- **Total**: 36 sign language instruction videos

## To Add Videos:
1. Record or obtain sign language videos for each letter A-Z
2. Save them in this directory with the exact naming format (A.mp4, B.mp4, etc.)
3. The app will automatically load and play them in the Letters Learning Screen

## Notes:
- Videos should demonstrate proper ASL fingerspelling for each letter
- Consider having consistent lighting and background across all videos
- Files should be optimized for mobile playback
- The app handles video loading errors gracefully with placeholder content
